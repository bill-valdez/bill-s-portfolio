The jquery localized script can be replaced by either google or jquery's cdn

jquery.validateT.min is the jquery.validate script modified by Tiziana with Nick's code to make the validate script work with the more recent input types

validTests is a script that will check onblur if a field is required and if it is - tell the user right away with a dom insertion of text.
